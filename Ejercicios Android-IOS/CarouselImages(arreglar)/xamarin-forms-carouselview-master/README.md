# Xamarin.Forms CarouselView

_A version of this recipe that uses the **Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView** [from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView/), can be found on [this branch](https://github.com/chrisriesgo/xamarin-forms-carouselview/issues/37)._

Thanks to my friends at [Firefly Logic](https://github.com/FireflyLogic/couchbase-connect-14) and to [Michael Watson](https://github.com/xamarin/customersuccess/tree/master/samples/Xamarin.Forms/SliderView) for the inspiration in creating this custom control.

This control mirrors the functionality of the CarouselPage - except the "pages" are simply Content Views.

I have examples that show the CarouselView used as:

- A full-page control with no page indicators
- A gallery-style control with **dots** as page indicators
- A full-page control with **tabs** as page indicators
